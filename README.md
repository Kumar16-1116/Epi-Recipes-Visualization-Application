# Epi-Recipes-Visualization-Application

## Overview
The **Epi-Recipes-Visualization-Application** is an interactive visualization tool that analyzes over 20,000 recipes. This project aims to explore the factors influencing food enjoyment and cooking preferences through insights derived from recipe ratings, nutritional information, and assigned categories.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Users can explore trends and nutritional patterns using various charts and graphs in Power BI.
- **Calorie vs. Rating Analysis**: Insights on how calorie content affects recipe ratings.
- **Protein and Fat Distribution Analysis**: Correlation analysis between protein and fat content across recipe ratings.
- **Recipe Count Analysis**: Visualization of recipe counts based on protein content bins.

## Data
The application utilizes a dataset containing:
- **Recipe Ratings**: Ratings provided by users for each recipe.
- **Nutritional Information**: Data on calories, protein, fat, and sodium content for each recipe.
- **Recipe Categories**: Categorization of recipes for better organization and analysis.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **Microsoft Power BI**: Ensure you have Power BI Desktop installed to run and interact with the visualizations.

### Installation
1. Download the dataset and Power BI file from the repository.
2. Open the Power BI file (`Epi-Recipes-Visualization.pbix`) in Microsoft Power BI Desktop.

### Usage
- Explore the interactive dashboard to analyze various aspects of the recipes.
- Utilize different visualizations, such as histograms, column charts, and donut charts, to gain insights into recipe popularity and nutritional content.

## Presentation
A PowerPoint presentation is included to summarize the findings and insights derived from the analysis. The presentation covers:
- Overview of the analysis objectives.
- Key findings from the calorie vs. ratings analysis.
- Insights into protein and fat distribution.
- Recommendations based on the analysis.

## Future Work
- Enhance the dashboard with additional data such as ingredient details and cooking methods.
- Implement user feedback mechanisms to improve the application.
